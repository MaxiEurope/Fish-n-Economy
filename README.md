## **FAQ**

### **1.) How do I earn money? 💰**

**If you are completely new to this bot, you have to use `+claim`.** You will get **100,000** 💶. (using it afterwards will **not** give you money!)

The next way is using the `+daily` command. You will get about **1000** 💶. The money amount will be increased each time you use the command. The amount can also be multiplied by **voting** and supporting me on **patreon**. The daily command resets every day at midnight (timezone: Europe/Vienna).

You can also get money when we reach certain servers, for example the **500** servers reward -> **500k 💶**. (`+reward`)
Another way is voting on [discordbots.org](https://discordbots.org/bot/486926264800903171) `+vote`, using the `+pls` command, `+pickup` (dropped money saved in channels) and sending money by using `+give`.
You can now also use the command `+work` to get more money.

**TL;DR:** `+claim, +daily, +pls, +pickup, +give, +reward, +work`

### **2.) How do I get xp for my pet? 🆙**

You can earn xp for your pet. Start by buying one in the shop `+shop`. You can now battle `+battle` and earn xp by fishing/`+fishbot`. See fish stats by using `+fish info`. Higher pet lvl gives you more **hp/dmg** and increases your chance of winning.

### **3.) How do I fish? 🐟**

The first item you will get from using `+fish` is a fishing rod. From now on you are ready to start the adventure! Catch up to **5** fish out of a huge range of available fish.

See all ranks/profit/xp by using `+fish info`. View your catched fish by using `+stats fish`. Fish is sold **automatically**.

### **4.) How do I setup the fishbo(a)t? 🎣**

Using the `+fishbot` for the first time will spawn a fishing boat. By default, you will get **automatically 2500** fish in **12 hours** after starting the boat by using `+fishbot 2500`. Upgrade it (add items) by using **fishbot items**, for example `+fishbot add 101 12`. You can get them by manually fishing. They have a **0.8 %** chance altogether.

> 🐛 **bug** - add those to get more fish = **+1 per item/5000 max**

> 🥊 **boxing glove** - get more xp for your pet = **+100 per item/150000 xp max**

> 💰 **moneybag** - start cheaper fishbot = **-1 per item/150 :euro: min**

### **5.) How do I battle? ⚔**

First off you need a pet. Buy one by using visiting the shop. Each pet has different stats, therefore different price. You can buy extras (food) in the shop (page 2). They can give your pet extra **hp** and/or extra **dmg**.

Add food by checking your inventory and using `+pet additem <food-ID>` (food-ID = the ID of the extras in your inventory). Remove your items any time you want by using `pet removeitem <food-ID>`. Change your pets name by using `+pet rename <name>`. View your pets info by calling the `+pet` command.

The fourth item you can fish is the 🛡 **shield**. It has a **0.2 %** catch rate and gives your pet **40 %** extra hp for **50** turns.  Check your inventory and activate this item by using `+pet add 103`.

### **6.) Can I sell something? 💹**

Yes! But **only food** (pet extras) and **fishbot items** (upgrades). Fish is sold **automatically**.

### **7.) How do I work? 😓**

First, you need a job. Find the perfect one by visiting the **jobcentre** (`+jobcentre`). Apply to the open ones (*✅*) by using the command `+apply 1`, where's 1 the number of the job (in this case a sellerman).

Make sure to work (by using the command `+work`) in the Fish n Economy server to get more money 🤑.

### **8.) How do I get more points? 🎫**

Each time you work (`+work`) you get **1** point (not depending on the job). 
View you current points by visiting the jobcentre (`+jobcentre`). 

If you have enough points for a specific a job, the emoji will swap from ❌ to ✅, which means you can apply for this job by using the command `+apply 9`, where's 9 the number of the job (in this case a youtuber).

You can see the required points for the job next to your dream job in the jobcentre (`+jobcentre`), for ex.: [p: **250**] (you need 250 points for that job).

💁 You can apply as many times you want, but the cooldown will stay after swapping the job.
